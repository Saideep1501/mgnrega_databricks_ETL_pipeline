# mgnrega_databricks_ETL_pipeline
This project builds an ETL pipeline for MGNREGA data on Databricks. Raw CSVs are sourced from open government portals and ingested into Databricks catalog volumes. The pipeline then transforms, cleanses, and enriches the data through multiple stages, making it analytics-ready for reporting and insights.
